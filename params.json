In fact we don't do nottin' with your password, it will never leave the native mac input field and nothing will be saved or tranfered in any way).\r\n\r\n- If you're bored with your new hosts, you can toggle the button (use custom hosts), which will restore your original hosts file. Everytime you toggle that button a copy will be saved to ensure you won't ever be homeless or better said, hostsless! \r\n- In retrospect, ignore comment above. It seemed funny at the time, but i'm now definately questioning my sense of humor!\r\n\r\n## Iphone/Ipad??\r\n- We are currently investigating the possibility to launch this same app for iPhone/iPad and support is always welcome (in any form)!\r\n\r\n![the_mrs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nootbyte/hostess/master/hostess%20active.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n***",
